How to operate:
make sure camera is pointed at target
For the love of god don't physically move the camera, move the gun itself
type python send_img.py


How to restart system:
On Pi:

Unplug power to Pi

Open "sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2"

type python receive_xy.py

type python send_img.py

On Shawns computer:

password is TrueNorth

open terminal

sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3 (type password again)

cd tn-emulator

python server.py

Possible errors and solutions:

problem:
It loops forever printing same pos

solution:
cntrl-c and start over

problem:
cannot take max() of zero sequence

solution:

if happening multiple times:
(on shawn's laptop)
vim server.py
modify RED_LOWER so last array value is lower

otherwise:
take another photo

problem: The camera doesn't take a picture, and says something in red like "Couldn't access device in dev/0" or something like that.
Restart pi.
